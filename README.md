# Arduino-Robotic-Hand-Control
Control Arduino-based robotic hand by EMG muscle data with simple machine learning algorithm

Student project on creating a basic machine learning algorithm to control a Arduino-Uno based robotic hand by EMG data from on-skin electrodes.
Repository contains arduino source code for passing raw EMG data to computer and python3 code for analysing and sending control signals
